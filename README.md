Note that PREP should be used daily and practiced to solve codewars

## Prep - Parameters, Returns, Examples, Pseudocode


1 - Ask first if you can take notes when they are telling you the code challenge
  - `print out 1 to sum value where sum is an argument provided by user, if num divisible 3 === fizz, 5 === buzz, 3 and 5 fizzbuzz`
  
2 - Ask about parameters
  - Questions like FizzBuzz: Will the argument always be positive or floated number, will it be a negative number?
  - This way they know you are thinking of all the possible issues that may come up
 



```js
function fizzBuzz(num) {
  // pseudo code
  // conditionals %3&5, % 3, %5
   // console.log num or fizz, buzz, fizzBuzz

}

// 3 - Returns examples
fizzBuzz(5); //1, 2, fizz, 4, buzzz
fizzBuzz(3); // 1, 2, fizz
fizzBuzz(15); // 1, 2 fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz
```
